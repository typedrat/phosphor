# Phosphor Database
#
# Decay terms are explicit per phosphor. Sources:
#   - Selomulya et al. (2003): P1 Mn²⁺ thin-film bi-exponential
#   - Kuhn (2002): P22 Green/Blue PMT impulse response
#   - ZnO:Zn literature: P15, P24 single-exponential
#
# For dual-layer phosphors (marked dual_layer = true), the [fluorescence]
# and [phosphorescence] sub-tables define per-layer emission. For
# single-layer phosphors, top-level peak_nm/fwhm_nm apply to both layers.
#
# Phosphors with only Tektronix 10%/1%/0.1% decay-time data (P2, P3, P4,
# P7, P14, P17, P20, P32) are omitted pending better impulse-response
# measurements to produce accurate multi-term fits.
