# Decay times are in seconds. Emission peaks are approximate Gaussian
# profiles characterized by center wavelength and FWHM.
#
# For dual-layer phosphors (marked dual_layer = true), the [fluorescence]
# and [phosphorescence] sub-tables define per-layer emission. For
# single-layer phosphors, top-level peak_nm/fwhm_nm apply to both layers.
